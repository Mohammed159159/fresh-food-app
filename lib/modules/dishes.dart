  If you're not a fan of romaine, feel free to substitute your favorite lettuce, like butter lettuce or iceberg lettuce.""",

If you donâ€™t have access to kalamata olives for whatever reason, black olives work just as well as a substitute.
Freshly chopped oregano can be substituted for dried oregano."""
